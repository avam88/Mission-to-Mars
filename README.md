# Mission-to-Mars
### Mission-to_mars is an exploration of web scraping functions and methods imbedded in the Selenium library to ultimately parse, manipulate and store data related to Mars updates from a NASA hosted website. This project is an excersize in using and interfacing 5 unique languages and platforms; Flask, Python, Jupyter Notebook, HTML and MongoDB. We're exploring MongoDB as a non-relational database to store data that we are scrpaing using libraries in Jupyter Notebook. We're exploring Flask as an opportunity to visualize and share our data on a web browser and incorporation HTML code to help stylize our web application to maximize readability and user-friendliness.
